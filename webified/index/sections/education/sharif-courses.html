<p>This course presents modern software engineering techniques and examines the software life-cycle, including software specification, design, implementation, testing and maintenance. The course gives an overview of methods and techniques used in agile software processes, contrasts agile approaches with traditional software development methods, and discuss the sweet spots of both classes of methodologies. Other non-agile commonly used approaches along with Process improvement initiatives such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and Personal Software Process (PSP) will also be discussed in this course.</p>
