      DataDays was **the First and Still the Largest National Data Scientific Competition** held annually by Sharif University of Technology.
      Its main goal is to broaden the appeal for working on data-driven problems. In essence, Datadays is a large-scale attempt at assessing
      data science knowledge in Iran and improving it.

      Every year, a group of volunteer data science experts gathers around to create and hold Datadays. I had the
      pleasure to lead the 2021's Datadays team, a diverse international group of Iranian Machine Learning and data
      science academic and industrial experts. After intense negotiations with various tech giants and startups in Iran,
      [Torob.ir](https://torob.ir/), an emerging product searching platform, joined us as our sponsor. After weeks
      of preparations, we developed a data-driven challenge around Torob's search logs to recommend new products given a raw query.

      To teach our participants about the fundamental concepts regarding Machine Learning and Recommender Systems, I authored a roadmap and
      led the scientific staff in creating Persian Educational notebooks. I also started a talk series and organized workshops by
      inviting tech and academic experts. To host the competition, I led the talks with [RoboEpics](https://roboepics.com/), a Kaggle like platform for hosting
      AI competitions, and eventually authored a contract between Datadays, Torob, and Roboepics. Our competition was held during the
      summer of 2021 and had over 500 participants internationally.

      In Datadays's first year, I was in change of the infrastructure required to hold the contest. Our challenge was computationally heavy and could
      benefit a lot from accelerated hardware so I volunteered to setup and maintain a GPU cluster of over 40 units, for our contestants.

      I also co-develop the Datadays contests platform by contributing to its user-interface implementation.

      WSS is a well known seminar series held annually by Sharif University of Technology. It hosts talks and presentations
      from international academic experts in advanced topics of computer science and engineering. During WSS 2020, I volunteered as
      one of the presentation organizers.
