Hi! This is Vahid! I am currently a senior undergraduate computer engineering student at
Sharif University of Technology. I enjoy researching both the theoretical and practical sides of Deep Learning,
and Artificial Intelligence and relish mathematically-inspired research in general. 

My skillset involves building scalable ML systems and working on large-scale distributed computing.
I enjoy developing Deep Learning models, implementing real-time data processing pipelines, 
analyzing/optimizing performance, and writing ML software that powers applications to meet 
the problems' needs. To achieve these goals, I leverage my extensive engineering and mathematical background.

More than enjoying building ML and AI systems,
I relish researching the foundations behind commonly practiced AI/ML methods and
often lose myself in the quest for more sophisticated and mathematically sound ML 
and AI solutions that are infinitesimally closer to the holy grail of Artificial General 
Intelligence. I have a multitude of research experiences in both the practical and theoretical sides of
Deep Learning and am currently working on a number of research projects. I also love to strengthen
my understandings by teaching. To that end, I have volunteered as a Scientific consultant and Teaching assistant in
numerous AI/ML-related courses and academic events. 

**My research interests include** <small>(but are not limited to)</small>:
 Explainable ML, Theoretical foundations of DL, Adversarial (ML/DL) Robustness, Deep Probabilistic and Generative models, Reinforcement Learning, Classical Learning Theory, Unsupervised ML, specially Anomaly Detection.
