Hi there! I'm Vahid, a Machine Learning Researcher & Engineer based in Canada with over three years of industry experience under my belt. I have a knack for solving problems through a mathematical lens, particularly in the realm of deep learning and computer vision. I earned my MSc in Applied Computing from the University of Toronto, where I delved into causal inference and low-level vision. I also hold a BSc in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, in which I focused on unsupervised deep learning and anomaly detection. Along my journey, I've been fortunate to work with some truly amazing people, enhancing both my professional and personal growth. The following is a brief summary of my academic and professional background. 

Since the end of my studies, I've been exploring consultation roles, on the lookout for the ideal full-time position that aligns with my interests in Machine Learning R&D. I'm also open to roles in data science, software engineering, and product management. If you're interested in discussing potential opportunities or collaborations, feel free to reach out and let's build the future together!
