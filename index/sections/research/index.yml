      - Co-developed a fully differentiable Bayesian algorithm for causal structure discovery with Autoregressive Normalizing Flows extending the  identiability of LSNMs to beat the SOTA in real-world datasets.
      - Developed [DyPy](https://github.com/vahidzee/dypy) & [Lightning-Toolbox](https://github.com/vahidzee/lightning-toolbox) for fast implementation of complex deep learning research experiments, cutting the amount of raw code in half on average.

      - Assessed the potential of repurposed adversarial training of robust reconstructive models for visual anomaly detection tasks.
      - Developed a novel deep training procedure for anomaly detection using explicit density estimation, on par with SOTA Autoencoder-based methods.
      - Studied energy-based and other explicit deep density estimation models and developed [TorchDE](https://github.com/vahidzee/torchde), a unified pytorch library for deep density estimation.

    content: |
      - Assessed the state-of-the-art vehicle trajectory prediction models' explainability and reliance on different data priors.
      - Explored alternatives to rasterized data representation schemes and co-developed a Transformer based model that uses generic SVG inputs to perform reason-aware vehicle trajectory prediction tasks.
