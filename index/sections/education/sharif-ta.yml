    The following is a chronological list of my teaching assistantship experiences at Sharif University of Technology, and the details of my
    responsibilities and contributions to the courses I have been involved in. I have been a teaching assistant for a total of 12 courses, in 19 separate offerings.
    I have been privilaged to teach and assist in a wide range of courses, from introductory undergraduate courses to graduate courses, and I am
    more than grateful for the opportunity to have been able to work with such a diverse set of students and instructors.
