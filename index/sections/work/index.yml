      In June 2020, I was approached by the Advanced Technology Lab (a.k.a ZLAB) of Fanap holdings, 
      a well-known mother administrative corporation in charge of many of Iran's tech and financial giants like 
      [Arvan Cloud](https://www.arvancloud.com/en) or [Pasargad Electronic Payment](https://pep.co.ir/en/). ZLAB is Fanap's most advanced Research and Development 
      laboratory and one of (if not) the most productive industrial labs in applied Machine Learning in Iran.

      I mainly worked on a collaborative project with [Neshan](https://neshan.org/#about), Iran's most widely used navigation platform. 
      During this project, I **created a novel Satellite and Aerial Imagery super-resolution model capable of 
      upsampling urban maps up to 8 times their original resolution**. My other projects include, **designing a commercial GPU sharing 
      platform** to provide high-level decentralization abstraction to Deep Learning training procedures. I also 
      **created a generic object-oriented deep training and prototyping framework** for highly complex and fully automated 
      robust training and evaluation procedures focusing on the separation of deep architecture design with model
      initialization and hyperparameters, and the reusability of training algorithms regardless of the data or
      model at hand. 

      I also consulted in other projects, such as generating Persian carpet patterns with GANs and 
      the AI Platform as a Service projects.

      After about a month of prep and intense interviews, in July 2019, I got accepted to 
      join Cafebazaar as a Chaos Engineering Intern out of over a thousand applicants 
      from all backgrounds and ages. Cafebazaar, the largest Android marketplace 
      platform in Iran, is a nation-famous tech giant with a userbase of near 50 
      million. During the summer of 2019, I was one of the youngest software 
      engineers working there. 

      My job was to simulate both internal and external chaotic scenarios and to create
      monitoring and prevention systems. To this end, I helped **develop a 
      Kubernetes node failure simulator** and **designed a monitoring system for
      intra-cluster networks**. I then **created a decentralized pipeline for 
      heavy user-activity simulations**, which employed the statistical structure 
      of Cafebazaar's exposed APIs and controlled DDOS attacks to mimic similar user 
      behaviors. My codes were deployed and put to use by the end of the summer when I 
      left Cafebazaar to focus AI related subjects.

      In June 2018, I joined a start-up called Pido, one of the largest Fuel Delivery companies 
      in the Middle East, with my dear friend [Mr. Soroush Farghadani](http://farghadani.me/). 
      Our work was mainly on a collaboration project between Pido and [PEC](https://en.pec.ir/), 
      a primary Payment Service Provider in Iran. We **developed a method to scan Persian and 
      English debit cards and extract their information** and **proposed a 
      novel algorithm to mitigate the effects of arbitrary illumination environments** in 
      removing the digits' backgrounds for better Optical Character Recognition performance.
