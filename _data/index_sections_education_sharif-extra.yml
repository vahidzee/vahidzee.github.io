    \ competition held annually by Sharif University of Technology.\nIts main goal\
    \ was to broaden the appeal for working on data-driven problems. In essence, Datadays\
    \ was a large-scale attempt at assessing\ndata science knowledge in Iran and improving\
    \ it.</p>\n<p>Every year, a group of volunteer data science experts gathers around\
    \ to create and hold Datadays. I had the\npleasure to lead the 2021's Datadays\
    \ team, a diverse international group of Iranian Machine Learning and data\nscience\
    \ academic and industrial experts. After intense negotiations with various tech\
    \ giants and startups in Iran,\n<a href=\"https://torob.ir/\">Torob.ir</a>, an\
    \ emerging product searching platform for commerce, joined us as our sponsor.\
    \ After weeks\nof preparations, we developed a data-driven challenge around Torob's\
    \ search logs to recommend new products given a raw query.</p>\n<p>To teach our\
    \ participants about the fundamental concepts regarding Machine Learning and Recommender\
    \ Systems, I authored a roadmap and\nled the scientific staff in creating Persian\
    \ Educational notebooks. I also started a talk series and organized workshops\
    \ by\ninviting tech and academic experts. To host the competition, I led the negotiations\
    \ with <a href=\"https://roboepics.com/\">RoboEpics</a>, a Kaggle like platform\
    \ for hosting\nAI competitions, and eventually authored a contract between Datadays,\
    \ Torob, and Roboepics. Our competition was held during the\nsummer of 2021 and\
    \ had over 500 participants internationally.</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\

    \ of DataDays, I was in charge of the computational infrastructure. Our challenge\
    \ was computationally heavy and could\nbenefit a lot from accelerated hardware\
    \ so I volunteered to setup and maintain a GPU cluster of over 40 units for our\
    \ contestants.</p>\n<p>I also co-develop the Datadays contests platform by contributing\
