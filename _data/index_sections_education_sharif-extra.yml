    \ competition held annually by Sharif University of Technology.\nIts main goal\
    \ was to broaden the appeal for working on data-driven problems. In essence, Datadays\
    \ was a large-scale attempt at assessing\ndata science knowledge in Iran and improving\
    \ it.</p>\n<p>Every year, a group of volunteer data science experts gathers around\
    \ to create and hold Datadays. I had the\npleasure to lead the 2021's Datadays\
    \ team, a diverse international group of Iranian Machine Learning and data\nscience\
    \ academic and industrial experts. After intense negotiations with various tech\
    \ giants and startups in Iran,\n<a href=\"https://torob.ir/\">Torob.ir</a>, an\
    \ emerging product searching platform for commerce, joined us as our sponsor.\
    \ After weeks\nof preparations, we developed a data-driven challenge around Torob's\
    \ search logs to recommend new products given a raw query.</p>\n<p>To teach our\
    \ participants about the fundamental concepts regarding Machine Learning and Recommender\
    \ Systems, I authored a roadmap and\nled the scientific staff in creating Persian\
    \ Educational notebooks. I also started a talk series and organized workshops\
    \ by\ninviting tech and academic experts. To host the competition, I led the negotiations\
    \ with <a href=\"https://roboepics.com/\">RoboEpics</a>, a Kaggle like platform\
    \ for hosting\nAI competitions, and eventually authored a contract between Datadays,\
    \ Torob, and Roboepics. Our competition was held during the\nsummer of 2021 and\
    \ had over 500 participants internationally.</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\

    \ was computationally heavy and could\nbenefit a lot from accelerated hardware\
    \ so I volunteered to setup and maintain a GPU cluster of over 40 units for our\
    \ contestants.</p>\n<p>I also co-develop the Datadays contests platform by contributing\

    \ AI research and development in Iran using a game-like competition format.\n\
    Each year, a group of volunteer developers, algorithms and AI experts gather around\
    \ to design a challenge in form of a multi-agent video game. This event is a huge\
    \ undertaking\nand requires a lot of technical effort both in terms of the game\
    \ development and the AI challenge design. </p>\n<p>During the 2020's SAIC, I\
    \ volunteered as a junior scientific staff member and helped design the game environment\
    \ and the AI challenge. My main responsibility was to anylize \ncandidate game\
    \ environments and scenarios from the perspective of implementing Reinforcement\
    \ Learning agents and the feasibility of the optimal policy search.</p></div>\n\

    col-12 col-md-8\"><p>During the 2019's SAIC, I volunteered as a junior infrastructure\
    \ developer and helped the senior developers in setting up the game environment\
    \ and the AI challenge.\nOur team was in charge of developing and maintaining\
    \ the game server environment and evaluation backbone. Users recieved a local\
    \ copy of a game server implementing the \ngame logic, and two game clients implementing\
    \ the AI agents competing against each other. For example, for a game of chess,\
    \ the server would implement the rules of chess\nand expect two clients to send\
    \ their moves in each turn. Players are also arbitrary programs that recieve the\
    \ game state and return their move based on their strategy by sending\nit to the\
    \ game server. </p>\n<p>During the challenge, players could run a local copy of\
    \ the game server and test their agents against itself or our provided baseline\
    \ agents, or submit their agents to our central \nchallenge competition server\
    \ and request a match against other players. The winner of the competition was\
    \ determined by performing a round-robin tournament between all submitted agents\
    \ at\nthe end of the competition.</p>\n<p>As a member of the infrastructure team,\
    \ we inherited the codebase for a central competition runner, and we were responsible\
    \ to adjust the code base to accomodate the new game environment. \nThe system\
    \ had a central server written in Django that recieved two agents to compete against\
    \ each other and asynchronously ran the game and returned the evaluated results.\
    \ This central Django server outsourced\ncrone jobs to containerize the two agents\
    \ and the game server and then run the game on a docker cluster. The techstack\
    \ for the previous year was based on DockerSwarm but we migrated everything to\
    \ Kubernetes. \nThis was my first experience with containerization and orchestration\
    \ technologies and I learned a lot about the challenges of running a distributed\
    \ system.</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>"
