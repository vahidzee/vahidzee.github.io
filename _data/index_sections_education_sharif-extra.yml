    \ competition held annually by Sharif University of Technology.\nIts main goal\
    \ was to broaden the appeal for working on data-driven problems. In essence, Datadays\
    \ was a large-scale attempt at assessing\ndata science knowledge in Iran and improving\
    \ it.</p>\n<p>Every year, a group of volunteer data science experts gathers around\
    \ to create and hold Datadays. I had the\npleasure to lead the 2021's Datadays\
    \ team, a diverse international group of Iranian Machine Learning and data\nscience\
    \ academic and industrial experts. After intense negotiations with various tech\
    \ giants and startups in Iran,\n<a href=\"https://torob.ir/\">Torob.ir</a>, an\
    \ emerging product searching platform for commerce, joined us as our sponsor.\
    \ After weeks\nof preparations, we developed a data-driven challenge around Torob's\
    \ search logs to recommend new products given a raw query.</p>\n<p>To teach our\
    \ participants about the fundamental concepts regarding Machine Learning and Recommender\
    \ Systems, I authored a roadmap and\nled the scientific staff in creating Persian\
    \ Educational notebooks. I also started a talk series and organized workshops\
    \ by\ninviting tech and academic experts. To host the competition, I led the negotiations\
    \ with <a href=\"https://roboepics.com/\">RoboEpics</a>, a Kaggle like platform\
    \ for hosting\nAI competitions, and eventually authored a contract between Datadays,\
    \ Torob, and Roboepics. Our competition was held during the\nsummer of 2021 and\
    \ had over 500 participants internationally.</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\

    \ developer and helped the senior developers in setting up the game environment\
    \ and the AI challenge.\nOur team was in charge of developing and maintaining\
    \ the game server environment and evaluation backbone. Users recieved a local\
    \ copy of a game server implementing the \ngame logic, and two game clients implementing\
    \ the AI agents competing against each other. For example, for a game of chess,\
    \ the server would implement the rules of chess\nand expect two clients to send\
    \ their moves in each turn. Players are also arbitrary programs that recieve the\
    \ game state and return their move based on their strategy by sending\nit to the\
    \ game server. </p>\n<p>During the challenge, players could run a local copy of\
    \ the game server and test their agents against itself or our provided baseline\
    \ agents, or submit their agents to our central \nchallenge competition server\
    \ and request a match against other players. The winner of the competition was\
    \ determined by performing a round-robin tournament between all submitted agents\
    \ at\nthe end of the competition.</p>\n<p>As a member of the infrastructure team,\
    \ we inherited the codebase for a central competition runner, and we were responsible\
    \ to adjust the code base to accomodate the new game environment. \nThe system\
    \ had a central server written in Django that recieved two agents to compete against\
    \ each other and asynchronously ran the game and returned the evaluated results.\
    \ This central Django server outsourced\ncrone jobs to containerize the two agents\
    \ and the game server and then run the game on a docker cluster. The techstack\
    \ for the previous year was based on DockerSwarm but we migrated everything to\
    \ Kubernetes. \nThis was my first experience with containerization and orchestration\
    \ technologies and I learned a lot about the challenges of running a distributed\

    \ and second\nyear undergraduate students interested in learning the in and outs\
    \ of becoming a full-stack developer, offering a crash-course in Front-End and\
    \ Back-End software engineering. The participants then \ncompete in desigining\
    \ a fully functional website that satisfies a set of predefined user stories.\
    \ </p>\n<p>As a team of two, we designed and implemented a similar system as the\
    \ game-runner in SAIC, where a central Django server \nWe integrated our system\
    \ with Sharif's GitLab (where the consestants were supposed to push their codes),\
    \ to automatically build an image of each contestants code.\nGiven a judgement\
    \ request, we then containerized these images along with a our own unit testing\
    \ program that connects and interacts with the each contestants implementation\
    \ of the website.\nWe wrote our unit tests with dynamicity of the contestants\
    \ Front-Ends in mind, to analyzes the produced HTTP outputs by cross-checking\
    \ the existance of a set of predefined qualities in each supposed web-page. \n\
    The result of each unit tests were then returned to other micro-services developed\
